title: Rename `MailMessageAction` class and its related services
type: change
description: |
  The name was confusing as it was actually handling `Message` records and not `MailMessage` records.
  * Legacy `MailMessageAction` has been replaced by `MessageAction`.
  * Legacy `MailMessageActionService` has been replaced by `MessageActionService`.
  * Legacy `MailMessageActionServiceImpl` has been replaced by `MessageActionServiceImpl`.
