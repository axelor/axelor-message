title: Refactor email validation to use `EmailHelper` from `axelor-utils`
type: change
description: |
  Refactored `EmailAddressRepo` to delegate email validation to `EmailHelper.isValidEmailAddress()`
  from `axelor-utils` instead of maintaining a duplicate regex pattern.

  This ensures consistent email validation across all modules and centralizes the fix
  for dashes in intermediate domain segments (e.g., user@hdf.my-company.fr).
