title: Fix email validation for hyphens in domain segments
type: fix
description: |
  Refactored `EmailAddressRepo` to delegate email validation to
  `EmailHelper.isValidEmailAddress()` from `axelor-utils`.

  This fixes validation of emails with hyphens in intermediate domain
  segments (e.g., user@mkt.egym-wellpass.com) which were incorrectly
  rejected.
