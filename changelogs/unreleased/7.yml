title: Implement MailMessage action register
type: feature
description: |
  The previous problem revolves around the axelor mail message actions being over-written by numerous modules,
  and there's a sequential inheritance issue with that. To address this, we implemented  a mail message action
  registry that can identify classes that implements a generic class of the MailMessageAction 
  and then to execute those post actions in the generation of the message regardless of the behavior of other modules.
